Summarizer 3000
=======

What is it?
----------

Our project, The Summarizer 3000, is a tool for quickly rewriting and summarizing 
content from wikipedia. The Summarizer 3000 is a tool that will make writing short summary paragraphs easy. The tool helps you by providing a seed paragraph from Wikipedia about the relevant topic. As the user makes changes to the seed paragraph, the similarity to the original is calculated by the tool. The user can continue to make the document their own until it is suï¬ƒcently unique. The tool helps you crank out information gathered from the web in your own writing style.


Core algorithm
--------
The core algorithm is the similarity calculation. We compute the similarity
between your changes and the original wikipedia document. When you've rewritten
the content in your own words, the similarity score will reflect that.


How to run it
------
If you are interested in hosting the project yourself simply run the following command from the project's flask directory. `python writing_tool.py`. You will need to install nltk in order to run the project.
